## 🔧 Exercises
*You can put the answers/result in this area.*
### Research Software
  Write a short paragraph (max. 100 words) per question:
  1. Would you consider this Research Software or Software used in Research? Explain why.
Research Software. Because this is developed due to the needs of a specific project and it can only apply to certain area. And it has been published for other researchers to use it.

  3. Where does it fit in the research life cycle? Explain why.
Re-using stage. It is completed software and it is licensed but we dont know via what (cannot trace it back)
Last activity is
2 months ago in the repository Git. Now it is v4. Software Doc is up to date. Last built is 4 weeks ago: https://readthedocs.org/projects/ec-earth-4-docs/.

### Software in the Research landscape
Opensource 
Because we could contribute to the software. We thought FAIR would also fit but we could not find the license in the software repository.
We think also open science but classify it with that is a bit hard. Since explaining open science is hard.

### Software Management Plan
#### Purpose:
An Earth System Model (ESM) is a tool that integrates all our knowledge on the Earth system and can be used to address scientific hypothesis on climate and environmental change.

#### Version Control:
Git is being used for version control

#### Package:
There is no packages created from the software.

#### Testing: 
Not clear how to test it or maybe what testing means in its pupose (Can be explained on different ways)

#### User documentation:
Is available via 
https://ec-earth-4-docs.readthedocs.io/

#### Maintaining the software:
There are several people maintaining the software (+/-12)

#### Repository:
Is available in gitlab
https://git.smhi.se/ec-earth/doc
