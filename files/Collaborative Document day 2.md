## üè¢ Location logistics
* Coffee and toilets are in the hallway, just outside of the classroom.
* Please keep your cup for the rest of the day, you can clean it in the kitchen if you want to.
* If you leave the building, 
  be sure to be accompanied by someone from the escience center to let you back in through the groundfloor door
* For access to this floor you might need to ring the doorbell so someone can let you in
* In case of an emergency, you can exit our floor using the main staircase.
  Or follow green light signs at the ceiling to the emergency staircase.
* **Wifi**: Eduroam should work. Otherwise use the 'matrixONE' network, password should be printed out and available somewhere in the room.

If you attend the full workshop you can request a certificate of attendance by emailing to training@esciencecenter.nl.
Please request your certificate within 8 months after the workshop, as we will delete all personal identifyable information after this period.

## üîß Exercises

### Find the license for a software package (10 minutes)
Imagine that a researcher comes to you and asks whether they can use a particular software package that they found online. One aspect to consider would be its license, if there is one.
Pick a software package from the following list, and try to find out whether it has a license and if so which. The idea is to cover the list together, so let's not all start at the top!

| Software                      | License                                                                                                                                            |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Kernel Tuner                  | Apache-2.0 license                                                                                                                                 |
| nodal-dg                      | MIT license   / BSD license                                                                                                                        |
| OpenFOAM OpenFOAM 12 Released | GNU General Public Licence  GPLv3                                                                                                                  |
| MATLAB                        | Mathworks Limited license. You need to sign in to your MathWorks¬Æ Account to learn about the license. It costs ‚Ç¨900,- per year for individual use. |
| COPASI                        | Artistic licence 2.0 (OSI approved)                                                                                                                |
| Glotaran                      | GNU General Public License  LGPL-3.0 license                                                                                                       | 
| LinkAhead                     | GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE                                                                                                                  |
 **A few hints:**
The researcher only gave you the name. You'll have to find the code on the Internet first.
Licenses are not always advertised on a code's website. Try looking somewhere more technical if you can't find it in the documentation.


### Choose a license for or using your policy (10 minutes)
One of the concerns typically addressed in a software policy is licensing of software developed at the institution. Policies can choose a single license, or offer a range of options.
Try to find out whether your university has a license policy. What does it say about which license(s) to use? If you don't have a policy yet, which license(s) would you choose for your policy? Why?
Go to Choosealicense.com and play around with the options to help you choose.

**Answers:**

- Name: "my answer"
- WUR: WUR guidelines on protection and exploitation of software and data states (in short):
1. The owner of IP Rights on Software can provide External Parties with the right to use these IP Rights in the form of a License
2. Software Licensing can also take place through an Open Source Software License (OSS License). WUR approves the CC0, MIT, BSD, Apache, EUPL, GPL, AGPL, LGPL, proprietary
- Twente: MIT, BSD, Apache 2.0, GPL (LGPL, AGPL, EUPL 1.2), MPL
- Windesheim: none
- Amsterdam UMC (none, as far as I am aware). Advice given on case-by-case basis.

## üé≠ Tips and Tops

### üëé Tips
- Use [EduNL](https://edu.nl/) instead of tinyurl.com
- Avoid going on tangents and niche discussions during the presentation sessions; while these may be interesting for a small group, engagement of the group as a whole seems to diminish. They are best reserved for the breaks. Try to stay on topic as much as possible.
- Please limit the flow of discussion for the sake of time management
- The niche discussions as someone else pointed out as well- could have been cut a bit short. There were many indtances where this caused crunching the time for the actual course! They are useful but after a while can be distracting.
- Today we skipped the content on "comments" as documentation. I would have really enjoyed that topic so I was a bit disappointed we skipped it.
- Try to keep speed in the presentations, maybe by reducing the length of discussions about specific questions
- Sharing real-life experiences, e.g. FAQ from researchers.
- Maybe categorize the people where they are now, and where they want to be. 
- Check for spelling errors

### üëç Tops
- More interaction than during the previous session, which is great!
- The lunch [on the second day]! +5
- Really liked the interaction! Me too!
- The information on licensing is really helpful! 
- Really useful sessions, friendly and knowledgeable instructors. Thanks!
- Fruitful discussion between presenters and the group, nice to learn from each other.
- It was a useful session with a nice mix between presentation and interaction though the assignments - I also like the variety between topics and people that present the information. It really helps with the focus throughout the day.
- Nice interactions, nice that there were many short exercises during the day
- I learned a lot based on the content. But the great attitude of the instructures was even more helpful!
- The venues were amazing; great coffee, snacks and lunch.
- Nice interaction and discussions.
- Nice logistics again! Very accessible excerices and lots of engagement.

## Questions regarding homework
*We will check this area every day in the three weeks in between the workshop days to answer any questions you have regarding the homework. There are also two options for asking them live during the two online homework sessions ()*
