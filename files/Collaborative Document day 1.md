## 🎭 Tips and Tops

### 👎 Tips
- I wish that it would be more interactive 
- Initially (after the paper software intro), I would jump right into some modern software examples, makes bridging the concepts easy. For the research software part, I would have liked it if some contemporary softwares were introduced early on (helps with the explanation). 
- Some presentations were a big lengthy
- More exercises during the day, not keep it until the end
- Include an interactive element in the program right after lunch, so you can more easily manage the "after-lunch dip" - it's all very interesting, but it can be hard to focus during digestion :) 
- SMP requirement Documentation part, it is not easy to read the text, change the yellow background would be helpful:)
- Interesting but too much information. 
- The need for really, really (really!) promising you're using your institutional email address on Eventbrite. Yes, I pinky swear I do.
- The whole Eventbrite thing, it feels sketchy to say the least. When the signup was free this wasn't an issue that much, but now when you need to pay the image plays a big role. Asking for a fee to attend is quite logical and I'm happy to pay, but I had to upfront the money myself, which is quite a lot as an individual (in particular for say PhDs). Especially if you sign up quite late, there is no time to arrange a advance payment or do the purchasing through your institutions systems. It takes time, lots of time. And I imagine there is also a fee for you (and us if we cancel) to schedule via Eventbrite. It has a deterring effect, preventing from people signing up. SURF, for example, has a nice event scheduling thing where I login using my institutions account through SURFconnext, and I just need to fill in some accounting information (like budgets and numbers) and they arrange the payment automatically with my institution, no upfronting necessary, no pinky swear, because of SURFconnext.
- Icebreaker took a bit long and I found it is not that relevant to the whole class.

### 👍 Tops

- Good open atmosphere, low threshold for interacting
- Love your enthousiasm! Thanks :)
- Great logistic set up and presentations! Everything was very enjoyable and easy to follow( including lunch, coffee and drinks!) ! 
- CodiMD was very effective and engaging!
- Your consideration about beginners (ppl who are not amazing at software development)
- Great enthusiasm, fun exercises
- Plenty of useful and practical information and I love your enthusiasm and motivational spirit
- Loads of actual adn practical information, wouldnt go for less
- Nice website and organization for useful resources.

## Questions regarding homework
