## üóìÔ∏è Planning
*You can use this space to make a planning with your groupmates for working on the homework. Decide who will do what by when and make sure to keep some time for reviewing eachothers work and the final work.*

## üß† Collaborative Notes
*Use this area to make notes and document your discussions.*

## üîß Exercises
The software package **HyperCanny** can be accessed from Python and computes edges in large data sets in any number of dimensions. 

**Research Software**
For most applications this is **Software used in Research**. It is a computation package to support various research questions that may rise in large data research. Only in very specific research that focuses on improving the edge finding method this would be Research Software. 
This piece of software would be used in the **Processing & analyzing phase** of the Research Life Cycle. 

**Software in the Research landscape**
The developers of HyperCanny should: 
- **use the FAIR principles**: This software may be valuable for many applications, so make sure to share it with the community 
- **create a Software Management Plan**: The software will probably be improved in many iterations over time. This together with the value of sharing it, makes it important to think about the management of the software. 
- **Code Refinery**: The Code Refinery classes help to deal with issues that arise when developing the software. 


# Software Management Plan
This is the Software Management Plan for a project to investigate possible improvements of a speed estimator method. The project has already been finished, so this is a retrospective. Coding and running the code was a one-person activity. 

## Purpose
The software processes data that was collected with body worn sensors in various experiments. The software does custom selection of relevant signal parts, performs the speed estimation, and does analysis comparing estimations with recorded actual speeds. 

## Version control
Version control has been done in bitbucket. This could have been improved by more systematically saving and tagging all versions used to produce stored output, and tag the output as well. 

## Repository
Code was kept in the same repository where it was developed. This is a private repository where access is controlled and only possible for people within the organization. 

For FAIRness, the implementation of the improved speed estimator method, should have been published broader. However, this was against the organization's policy. 

## Documentation (user, deployment, developer)
Documentation consisted initially of in-code comments. This is fine for a first version. Finally, when we decided to publish results based on the analyses, brief separate explanations were added. This may have been explanations in email. Documentation in the code repository should be added, for example in markdown. This holds for all three targets (user, deployment, developer). 

In particular the software that implements the improved speed estimator method may be interesting for other users. For that part more effort for writing clear documentation would be valuable. 

## Software licensing and compatibility
The software is only accessible for a limited group within the organization. Therefore no license is added. 

## Maintenance
Re-use of the software is expected at most incidentally. Therefore no effort is put in maintenance. Users must verify that the software gives expected results themselves. This shall be noted in the documentation.
