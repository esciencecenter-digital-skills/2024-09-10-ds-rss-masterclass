#### Purpose

> Please provide a brief description of gspcr, stating its purpose and intended user community, if any.

It's a package to implement an existing analysis algorithm that was not supported in R. This is intended for a researcher analysing large social scientific datasets with a mix of continuous and categorical data.

#### Research Project Context

> Is there a research project associated with gspcr? Is it part of a call or consortium?

PhD Project at ... University.

#### IP Ownership

> Who has the Intellectual Property (IP) of  gspcr?

... University

#### Version control

> How will you manage versioning of gspcr? What versioning scheme will you apply?

Semantic Versioning 

> Which version control system will you use to manage your source code?

Git 

#### Repository
> Should gspcr be publicly available? Please provide links to the software if this is the case.

GitHub (link here) and CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gspcr/index.html)


#### Software Licensing and Compatibility

> What type of license will gspcr have?

MIT (MIT License)

#### Citation

> How will users of gspcr be able to cite your software? Please provide a link to your software citation file CFF and/or Digital Object Identifier (DOI) if available.

CFF to facilitate sharing desired citation information and DOI per release through Zenodo (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.10090400)


#### Documentation

> How will gspcr be documented for users?

- README.md 
- help files for the functions 
- tutorial paper on the Journal open source software


#### Developer documentation

> How will gspcr be documented for future developers?

I am planning to add: 
- code of conduct (https://github.com/amices/mice?tab=coc-ov-file#readme) 
- contributing guidelines (is it rude to open a pull request? this can reduce the "social anxiety" to contribute)


#### Deployment documentation

> How will the installation requirements, deployment- and testing instructions of gspcr be documented?

A description of how to install the software in the README.md is included. This Software is not meant at the moment to be deployed some cloud server.


#### Testing

> How will your software be tested? Please provide a link to automated testing results, if available.

Automatic unit testing is planned by the developer and testing from the hosting repository (CRAN).


#### Software Engineering quality

> Do you use a software quality checklist? If yes, which one?

Follow a style guide for the code. High-level of modularity is planned.


#### Packaging

> How will gspcr be packaged and distributed? Please provide a link to available packaging information (e.g. entry in a packaging registry, if available).

Package manager: CRAN

#### Maintenance

> How do you plan to procure long term maintenance of your software?

No specific plan. I will maintain it until I have time and energy.


#### Sustainability

> What measures will be taken during the project to ensure the long-term sustainability of gspcr?

Nice to have, not there yet.
Support
What level of support will be provided for your users and how will this support be organised?

> Does gspcr use or produce any data? Please provide a brief explanation and include a link to a Data Management Plan, if applicable.

Not applicable.


### Questions from us

- Purpose: Should we specify funding agenceis or similar/funding acknowledgments? Which 'hex' does that come under (if any)?
    - Jaro: I suppose specifying funding sources with a plan to secure funding could be put under the sustainability hexagon. 
- Should the SMP include justifications and explanations for decisions? Or just the decision itself (e.g., MIT licence).
    - Jaro: A little context of why this license is suitable for this software is often useful. Imaging you would look back in 3 years and wonder why you had chosen that license in the first place. 
- How formal should the SMP be? Is it for yourself?
    - Jaro: It is not only for yourself but also for (future) collaborators, and other stakeholders of the software. There are no official guidelines for formality. In my opinion it also really depends on the context or might change with the "management level" and the amount and type of other people that might be reading it. For the rest, I would say, it's a matter of taste.
